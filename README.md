# hello-world
repository for simple tutorial

Hi~ This is JongJin Lee
I am learning about github, which I have heard that most of developer are making best use of on the internet.
Actually, I have not been much on this, but what I am supposed to attend class for docker from tomorrow made me be interest in this.
I think I need to dig into more and more everything related to Cloud and Open Source Softwares, which I have not much on thoes as well until now, because IT is rapidly changing and evovling in many area. 
If I can not keep up with thoes technology, it would become true to lag behind someday all of sudden.
